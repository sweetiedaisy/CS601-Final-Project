                    Hi! This is me, Nana! I'm a German Shepherd and currently three and a half years old. 
                    My mom always calls me her 'little princess' because I'm such a good girl. I am very independent and obedient. 
                    I love sleeping and eating good food at home, but if someone comes near the house, I'm on alert because I want to protect my family.
                    <p>Here is a video of me, secretly recorded by my mom, snoring when I was six months old.</p>

                    This video is from last summer vacation when I played with my friend Datou in the river. I was so happy! I also snuck in a few sips of water. The water was a bit cool, but very good.

                    This video was taken when we returned to where we live. My mom was outside the house playing catch with me. I'm very talented; I caught the ball in an instant.

                    This video was taken during last year's summer vacation when my mom took me to climb White Mountain. 
                    The scenery from up there is very good, though it's quite windy and a bit cold. 
                    In the video, I just came down from the mountain and arrived at a small river in the foothills, where many kids were playing. 
                    But I was very well-behaved, I just looked around at the scenery without disturbing anyone.
