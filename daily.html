                    <p> I really enjoy cooking for my family and friends and love to explore different types of food. Sometimes, 
                        I even bake bread and cakes. Cooking is truly a therapeutic activity for me, 
                        and I feel very happy whenever the food I prepare is all eaten.</p>

                    <p>I often take Nana to dog meet-ups, especially on weekends. 
                        Everyone brings their dogs to the park to meet up, and Nana is always so happy to see so many little friends. 
                        At the end, we always take pictures to remember the occasion.

                    <p> Every autumn, I go to White Mountain to see the maple leaves, which has become a hobby of mine. 
                        Mid-October is the season to view maple leaves in New Hampshire, and every year I go to different spots to view the leaves and take many photos. 
                        The scenery there is truly beautiful, and the colors of the maple leaves are very stunning.</p>

                    <p>
                        I really enjoy going to a Pottery painting store in Boston. 
                        They have a lot of uncolored Pottery in the store, and you can choose the ones you like and then paint and color them. 
                        After you're done, they will bake them into finished products for you. 
                        You can also choose to mold your own Pottery, but that might be a bit too difficult for me.LOL
