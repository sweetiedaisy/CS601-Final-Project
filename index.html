                <h2>Hi everyone! This is me ~</h2>
                
                <p>
                    My name is YANTING ZHONG, but you can call me Daisy.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    I was born in China and embarked on a life-changing journey in 2011 when I immigrated to the United States. 
                    I graduated from Suffolk University, which marked the beginning of my passion for education and the power of knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a fan of diverse cultural experiences, reflected in my love for film, food, and K-pop music. 
                    My compassion and love for animals are embodied in my loyal German Shepherd, my faithful companion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm pursuing a master's degree in Software Development at Boston University. 
                    I aspire to become a software engineer. This goal stems from my technological aptitude and my ambition to make significant contributions to the dynamic field of software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Traveling has always been a significant part of my life. I've been fortunate to explore various parts of the world, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Korea, Taiwan, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Bangkok, Thailand. These experiences have broadened my perspectives and enriched my global understanding, impacting my personal and professional outlook.
                    With my steadfast commitment to personal growth and my ambitions in the technology industry, I believe I'm on a promising path to achieving my dreams.
